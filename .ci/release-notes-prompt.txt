You are drafting GitHub release notes.
Use the base notes, commit summaries, and closed issues below.
Output markdown with the following sections:
## Highlights (3-6 bullets, user-facing, concrete changes)
## What's Changed (use PR bullets from base_notes if present; otherwise use commit_summaries)
## Closed Issues (list issues; if none, say 'None.')

Rules:
- Do NOT include a "Full Changelog" line.
- If base_notes is empty or generic, build "What's Changed" from commit_summaries.
